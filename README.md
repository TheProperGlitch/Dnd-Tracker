## Goals
Our goal is to create a discord bot that can be used to run a Dungeons & Dragons encounter from the perspective of the DM. This will include making characters and creatures that can be put into an encounter. These encounters can be run by the user to simulate a D&D encounter, where the user can change and interact with the entities involved.
